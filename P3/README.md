# Instructions
Create a minimal version of the classic Lunar Lander game!

**Requirements:** 
- The player should fall slowly with gravity
- Moving left and right should change the acceleration (not the velocity)
- If the player touches a wall/rock, show the text “Mission Failed” 
- If the player touches the platform, show “Mission Successful”
